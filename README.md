# RP-FDSM
A soil type retrieval system based on diagnostic information.
Diagnostic information is a key element in the soil type retrieval process. This example code requires first obtaining DBF files of all potential diagnostic information based on digital soil mapping technology, and then obtaining multi-level soil type results through existing retrieval systems.
The mapping results of the diagnostic information were placed in the Diagnostic Information folder.
