# RP-FDSM
A soil type retrieval system based on diagnostic information.
Diagnostic information is a key element in the soil type retrieval process. This example code requires first obtaining DBF files of all potential diagnostic information based on digital soil mapping technology, and then obtaining multi-level soil type results through existing retrieval systems.
The mapping results of the diagnostic information were placed in the Diagnostic Information folder.
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Demo.ipynb`) and a small-scale example dataset to demonstrate the workflow of the ED-DSM framework. Due to the size and licensing restrictions of the full dataset used in the study, it cannot be shared here. However, the example data and detailed instructions in the notebook should enable researchers to reproduce the workflow and apply our method to their own data.

The full dataset used in this study is available upon request. Please contact the corresponding author for more information.
